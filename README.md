# Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

Welcome to the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist! This dataset contains information on 100k orders made at Olist Store between 2016 and 2018. These orders were placed on various marketplaces in Brazil. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of each order, covering order status, price, payment, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. Additionally, we've included a geolocation dataset that maps Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.

This is genuine commercial data that has been anonymized. References to companies and partners have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

## Join it With the Marketing Funnel by Olist

We've also released a Marketing Funnel Dataset that can be combined with this dataset to view orders from a marketing perspective. Instructions for joining the datasets are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## Context

This dataset has been generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist simplifies the connection between small businesses throughout Brazil and various sales channels. These merchants can sell their products through the Olist Store and have them shipped directly to customers using Olist's logistics partners. For more information.

After a customer makes a purchase from Olist Store, a seller is notified to fulfill the order. Upon the customer's receipt of the product or the estimated delivery date, the customer receives a satisfaction survey by email. In this survey, customers can rate their purchase experience and provide comments.

## Attention

- An order can contain multiple items.
- Each item may be fulfilled by a different seller.
- All text identifying stores and partners has been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

## Data Schema

The data is divided into multiple datasets to facilitate understanding and organization. Please refer to the following data schema when working with it:

## Classified Dataset

We had previously released a classified dataset, but it was removed in Version 6. We intend to release it again with a new dataset and data schema. In the meantime, you can use the classified dataset available in Version 5 or earlier.

## Inspiration

Here are some ideas for potential outcomes using this dataset:

- **NLP**: Analyze the review text across various dimensions.
- **Clustering**: Understand why some customers who didn't write reviews are either happy or unhappy.
- **Sales Prediction**: Utilize purchase date information to predict future sales.
- **Delivery Performance**: Explore delivery performance and optimize delivery times.
- **Product Quality**: Discover product categories that lead to customer dissatisfaction.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from this rich dataset or incorporate external public information.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Olist for releasing this dataset.
