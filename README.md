# Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

Welcome to the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist! This dataset contains information on 100k orders made at Olist Store between 2016 and 2018. These orders were placed on various marketplaces in Brazil. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of each order, covering order status, price, payment, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews.

This is genuine commercial data that has been anonymized. References to companies and partners have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

## Join it With the Marketing Funnel by Olist

Also released a Marketing Funnel Dataset that can be combined with this dataset to view orders from a marketing perspective. Instructions for joining the datasets are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## Context

This dataset has been generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist simplifies the connection between small businesses throughout Brazil and various sales channels. These merchants can sell their products through the Olist Store and have them shipped directly to customers using Olist's logistics partners. For more information.

After a customer makes a purchase from Olist Store, a seller is notified to fulfill the order. Upon the customer's receipt of the product or the estimated delivery date, the customer receives a satisfaction survey by email. In this survey, customers can rate their purchase experience and provide comments.
